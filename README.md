# Anamoly-Detection-on-PFS

SentiLog, is a pioneering approach in high-performance computing, specifically targeting parallel file systems (PFSes). Applies deep learning techniques to analyze developers' emotional context in logging statements for efficient anomaly detection.  By overcoming unique challenges in PFS log analysis, SentiLog establishes itself as a novel and effective solution in the evolving landscape of high-performance computing. In this project, we successfully implemented the BiLSTM model using Keras as mentioned in the paper[^1] also implemented another model using the Transformers

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Below are the required software/libraries that need to be installed
1. IDE: Visual Studio Code. You can use any other editors such as PyCharm/Spyder
2. Python
3. Keras Tensorflow
4. Numpy
5. sklearn
6. matplotlib
7. sklearn seaborn

### How to run
1. Download the files to your local machine
2. AOS-Project/filter contains the preprocessed data. You need to replace the file path accordingly.
3. **os-project.ipynb** demonstrates the BiLSTM model using the Tensorflow Keras framework.
5. os-transformer-model.ipynb demonstrates the Transformer model using the Tensorflow Keras framework.
6. Run each file separately to know the model definition, training and testing.
