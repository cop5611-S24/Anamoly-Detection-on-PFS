# Anamoly-Detection-on-PFS

<p>
 SentiLog represents an innovative strategy within high-performance computing, particularly focusing on parallel file systems (PFSes). It utilizes deep learning methods to examine the emotional context of developers' logging statements, aiming for efficient anomaly detection. By addressing specific hurdles in PFS log analysis, SentiLog emerges as a fresh and potent solution in the dynamic domain of high-performance computing. In our project, we effectively deployed the BiLSTM model via Keras, as outlined in the referenced paper. Additionally, we implemented another model employing Transformers, which exhibited slightly superior performance.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Below are the required software/libraries that need to be installed
1. IDE: Visual Studio Code. You can use any other editors such as PyCharm/Spyder
2. Python
3. Keras Tensorflow
4. Numpy
5. sklearn
6. matplotlib
7. sklearn seaborn

### How to run
1. Download the files to your local machine
2. AOS-Project/filter contains the preprocessed data. You need to replace the file path accordingly.
3. **os-project.ipynb** demonstrates the BiLSTM model using the Tensorflow Keras framework.
5. os-transformer-model.ipynb demonstrates the Transformer model using the Tensorflow Keras framework.
6. Run each file separately to know the model definition, training and testing.
